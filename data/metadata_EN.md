##### Abstract
In this paper, a highly compact coiled CDHRM (C-CDHRM) that mimics the coiling behavior of snakes is designed, including 12 fully-constrained rigid bodies, 36 double-screw retractors, and a coiled feeding mechanism that can coil or uncoil according to task needs. The kinematic model and planning method we proposed enable the bioinspired coiled manipulator to exert excellent dexterity and maneuverability.

##### Abstract
In this paper, a pose estimation method is proposed with the fusion of vision sensors, inertial sensors, and encoders. The proposed method achieves better performances on estimation error and update frequency than the original extended Kalman filter (EKF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF) algorithm, especially in complex environments.

- Developed a vertical chamber inspection robot for gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) in power substations. The robot consists of an all-terrain mobile chassis, a multi-level lifting platform, and a long-reach flexible manipulator.
- Participated in the configuration design of the long-reach flexible manipulator, which imitates the coiling motion of snakes and adopts a compact feeding structure. It achieves a cable-driven hyper-redundant manipulator (CDHRM) with a length of 2.2 meters, 24 degrees of freedom, and a diameter of 50 millimeters.
- Led the design of the control system for the CDHRM, mainly using CANOpen communication and realizing 36-axis high-precision synchronous control based on CODESYS and ROS.
- Led the planning algorithm design for the CDHRM, using a follow-the-leader biomimetic strategy to control the tip pose and segment posture of the highly redundant mechanism, meeting the needs of narrow-space obstacle avoidance operations.
