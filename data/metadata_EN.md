##### Abstract
In this paper, we propose a coiled cable-conduit-driven hyper-redundant manipulator (C-CDHRM) with great slenderness
and flexibility. By imitating the structure and behavior of a constricting snake, it can be uncoiled sequentially from a coiled storage state, led by the head. In terms of control methods, we propose a multi-layer control system that can make remote operations more accurate and reliable.

##### Abstract
In this paper, a highly compact coiled CDHRM (C-CDHRM) that mimics the coiling behavior of snakes is designed, including 12 fully-constrained rigid bodies, 36 double-screw retractors, and a coiled feeding mechanism that can coil or uncoil according to task needs. The kinematic model and planning method we proposed enable the bioinspired coiled manipulator to exert excellent dexterity and maneuverability.
