##### Abstract
In this paper, a highly compact coiled CDHRM (C-CDHRM) that mimics the coiling behavior of snakes is designed, including 12 fully-constrained rigid bodies, 36 double-screw retractors, and a coiled feeding mechanism that can coil or uncoil according to task needs. The kinematic model and planning method we proposed enable the bioinspired coiled manipulator to exert excellent dexterity and maneuverability.

##### Abstract
In this paper, a pose estimation method is proposed with the fusion of vision sensors, inertial sensors, and encoders. The proposed method achieves better performances on estimation error and update frequency than the original extended Kalman filter (EKF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF) algorithm, especially in complex environments.

- Developed an inspection robot for gas-insulated switchgear in power substations. The robot consists of an all-terrain mobile chassis, a multi-level lifting platform, and a cable-driven manipulator with a length of 2.2 meters, 24 degrees of freedom, and a diameter of 50 millimeters.
- Participated in the mechanism optimization of the manipulator, which imitates the coiling behavior of snakes and can coil to reduce storage space or uncoil to expand working range.
- Participated in the design of the control system for the manipulator, mainly using CANOpen communication and realizing 36-axis high-precision synchronous control based on CODESYS and ROS.
- Participated in the planning algorithm design for the manipulator, using a follow-the-leader biomimetic strategy and Multi-constraint redundant inverse kinematics to control the tip pose, meeting the needs of narrow-space obstacle avoidance operations.
